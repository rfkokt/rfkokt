### Hi, I’m Rifki 👋

I’m a frontend developer who cares deeply about clean UI, thoughtful UX, and high-quality code.  
My mission is to build interfaces that feel effortless to use and delightful to look at.

🛠️ I love working with:
- React, Next.js, and modern frontend stacks
- UI/UX design systems and micro-interactions
- Accessible, responsive, and performant web apps

🧠 Currently learning:
- Motion design in UI
- UX metrics (Core Web Vitals, a11y scores)
- Open source contribution strategies

📌 Projects I’m proud of:
- [`rdev.cloud`](https://rdev.cloud) – My blog and digital playground for frontend, UX, and experiments
- [See pinned repos below]

🌍 Open to collaboration, feedback, and interesting UI challenges!
